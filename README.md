Estimating New York City Traffic using Taxi Trip Data

Traffic is a common issue in all the cities. Estimating traffic can help in understanding the mobility, knowing heavily used routes and this information can be further linked to Air Quality by knowing vehiular emissions. This can help in making better policies for the city and also help in better city planning.
